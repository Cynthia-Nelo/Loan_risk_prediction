# 📊 Loan Risk Prediction Model
## 🧾 Overview
This project aims to build a robust and production-ready machine learning pipeline to predict loan applicant risk (Risk_Flag).

The pipeline includes:

Data loading

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Preprocessing

Feature engineering

Model training and evaluation

Fairness analysis

## 🎯 Goal

Classify applicants as either:

1 → Risky (likely to default)
0 → Not Risky (likely to repay)
This solution is designed to support risk-based decision-making in financial institutions.

## 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset is divided into training and test sets (JSON format). Each record represents an individual loan applicant described by demographic and financial attributes.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. Data Loading
- Loaded using pandas
- Parsed and validated JSON input
- Ensured schema consistency
  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps
- Explored feature distributions and class imbalance
- Categorical feature significance via Chi-squared test
  
3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Encoded categorical variables with OneHotEncoder
- Scaled numerical features (StandardScaler)
- Addressed class imbalance with SMOTE and ADASYN
  
4. Feature Engineering
- Created derived features:
- Income-to-Age Ratio
- Employment Bands
- Housing Duration Bins
- Selected features using correlation and importance scores
  
5. Model Development
Models trained:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Stacking Ensemble
- Tuned with RandomizedSearchCV and StratifiedKFold

6. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- F1-Score
- Precision
- Recall
- ROC AUC
⚠️ Focus on Accuracy and F1-Score for final selection

7. Bias & Fairness Analysis
- Audited predictions by:
- Age groups
- Income levels
- Location (CITY, STATE)
- Applied fairness strategies like:
- Equal opportunity checks
- Fair sampling and thresholding
